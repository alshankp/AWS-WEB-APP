High-Availability Web Application Deployment on AWS
This project shows how to deploy a scalable and reliable web application using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The goal is to ensure that a PHP-based website can handle high traffic and stay online, even if something goes wrong with one of the servers.

Key Features:

Auto Scaling: Automatically adds or removes servers (EC2 instances) based on how much traffic the site is getting. This keeps the website fast and responsive.
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distributes incoming traffic evenly across multiple servers, making sure no single server gets overloaded.
RDS (Relational Database Service): A managed MySQL database that stores your website's data. It’s set up for high availability, meaning it stays up even if one of the servers fails.
Security: Secure connections between servers and databases using AWS security settings.
Scalable Design: The website can grow by adding more servers automatically when needed, without downtime.
Technologies Used:

AWS EC2: Virtual servers that run the PHP website.
AWS RDS: A managed MySQL database for storing data.
AWS Auto Scaling: Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on traffic.
AWS Elastic Load Balancer: Distributes traffic evenly across servers.
MySQL: The database used for the web application.
PHP: The programming language used to build the website.
How to Set It Up:

Launch an EC2 instance to host the PHP website.
Set up Auto Scaling to add or remove EC2 instances as needed.
Create an RDS instance to store data for the website.
Update the website’s code to connect to the RDS database.
Configure security groups to allow safe communication between EC2 and RDS.
This project provides a simple way to make your web application scalable, reliable, and highly available in the cloud using AWS.
